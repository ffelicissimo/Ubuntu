Generate Keys And Create An SSL Certificate

In this section, you will run through the steps needed to create an SSL certificate. This article explains in detail about SSL certificates on Nginx.

Create the SSL certificate directory and switch to it.
$mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com
$cd /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com

#Create a private key:
$openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 2048

#Remove its passphrase:
$openssl rsa -in server.key -out server.key

#Create a CSR (Certificate Signing Request):
$openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

#Use this CSR to obtain a valid certificate from a certificate authority or generate a self-signed certificate with the following command.
$openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt


#Once this is done this directory will contain the following files:
- server.key - The private key
- ca-certs.pem - A collection of your CA's root and intermediate certificates. Only present if you obtained a valid certificate from a CA.
- server.crt - The SSL certificate for your domain name
